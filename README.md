I'm gonna make a webiste for some information about tech tips and computers and for
people who not have much information about how to do on front of computers, its
not a big deal anyway :D, but its being kinda funny. Anyway that is where I want
to start , in future I want to make a platform for improvement for some kind of 
stuffs like arts and anime stuffs , but thats for future. Right now this website
is for people who don't know much for computers and platforms that everyone use
for gaming and a little help them. (its sound cringe and not wow but I dont what
I have to make something with my free time like others, Im a nerd like others, 
what can I do with my life?:D)
